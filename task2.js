/*
Overview
Karel starts at 1st street and 1st avenue next to a pile of tennis balls that will be at 1st street and 2nd avenue. 
Karel doesnâ€™t know how many balls there are, but Karel must double the number of tennis balls in that spot. 
For example, if there are 3 balls there at the beginning, there should be 6 there after running this program.
